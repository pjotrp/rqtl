"To do" list for R/qtl
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is intended to contain a list of many of the additions and
revisions that are planned for the R/qtl package.  

If you any additions or revisions to suggest, please send an email to
Karl Broman, <kbroman@biostat.wisc.edu>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
SHORT TERM:

o Fix bug regarding X chromosome in fitqtl.

o Analysis of binary traits by "hk" in scanone/two.

o Implementation of binary traits in fitqtl, etc., with method="hk"

o In c.cross, include an argument for "flipping" a backcross, so that
  a backcross to (AxB)xB can be combined with an intercross

o plot of genotype frequencies / P-values

o function to identify the XO locations (based on countXO?)
  [this is locate.xo, I think, but just for a single chromosome.]

o qtl x covar interactions in stepwiseqtl

o special treatment of X chromosome in scantwo permutations and in
  stepwiseqtl 

o In plot.geno, allow use of xlim and ylim; also do this in
  plot.scanoneperm and plot.scantwoperm.

o Add an explanation regarding the coding in the coefficient 
  estimates in fitqtl().  Add text to the help file for
  summary.fitqtl(). 

o FAQ: - constructing covariate matrices

o function for getting x axis location in scantwo picture (like the
  new xaxisloc.scanone)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

MEDIUM-SHORT TERM:

o X chromosome for 4- and 8-way RIL by sibling mating (also 2-way RIL).

o Better way to make use of ... in plot functions that allows
  unmentioned defaults.

o plots of segregation ratios at markers

o method for having alternative genetic maps and for storing a
  physical map; linear interpolation for plotting scanone output in
  Mbp. 

o make various functions work appropriately with class "special"
  (eg, plot and summary)

o get scanone and scantwo to work with a single marker on a
  chromosome. 

o Fix convergence problems in scanone with method="ehk", especially
  in the case of covariates and interactions. 

o cM coordinates in scantwo plot for multiple chromosomes: Fix
  plot.scantwo for the case that incl.markers=TRUE, so that positions
  are not equally spaced, but are according to the genetic map.  (This
  is working if just one chromosome is plotted, but should be made to
  work generally.)

o Plotting scanone results for *many* phenotypes as an image plot.
  (Perhaps threshold the really high LODs and eliminate curves that
  fail to meet a given threshold.)

o lodint/bayesint as option to summary.scanone.

o conditional LOD scores from scantwo output.

o scanqtl: if formula symmetric w/ respect to two QTL that are on the 
  same chromosome, only scan the triangle (rather than the square)

o write tools for converting the output from scanqtl() to the format
  for scanone() or scantwo(), according to whether it's a 1-d or
  2-d search, or print a warning otherwise.

o pairprob at markers + putative QTL?  For linked loci in scanqtl by
  HK/EM. 

o Allow plot.geno (or other cases in which subset.cross is used to
  pull out individuals) to refer to individual IDs.

o Include Bjarke's code on eHK for scantwo.

o Go through all of the various plot functions and make sure that
  the x- and y-axis labels are created with axis() rather than
  text() and segments().  This way, the size of the labels can be
  modified with par(cex.axis)

o Turn the tutorial into a Sweave vingette, to conform to the
  Bioconductor requirements?

o Revise plot.rf so that it can have different color schemes, as in
  plot.scantwo.  Allow a zscale.

o Simpler methods to get at interesting bits in the est.rf results.

o Revise read.cross so that if all genotypes are 
  AA and BB, the thing is called DH by default.  Maybe add an 
  argument to read.cross so that one may specify the cross type?

o Finish off the work to get coefficient estimates by imputation in
  fitqtl for the X chromosome in BC and F2. 

o Revise c.cross so that you can combine crosses even if there are
  different numbers of chromosomes

o Documentation on RI lines.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

MEDIUM TERM:

o pull all of the genoprob and imputation information out of 
  the qtl objects and replace it with indices to the information
  in the cross object.  (This stuff takes up too much space!)

o For the stepwiseqtl function:
   - should be able to save all models with plod within some value
     of the best model 
   - QTL x covariate interactions in countterms
   - it'd be nice to be able to have all models that are one term
     away from the optimal model (maybe this could be a separate
     function) 
   - it'd be nice to be able to easily make a plot of the final model
     plus information about all models that are one term away

o revise read.cross with format="mm" to deal with ril by selfing
  and/or sib mating

o covariates with 2part model in scanone

o X chromosome in cim().

o Analysis of censored phenotypes.

o Analysis of residuals.

o read.cross for "qtx" sometimes doesn't seem to take the
  genotype pattern appropriately; read in a backcross as if it
  were an F2. 

o An NA in the mapmaker data file caused an error in read.cross;
  the line became too long.  Maybe this is true whenever an item
  doesn't match what is expected.

o Speed up read.cross.mm; deliver meaningful errors if map/genotypes
  don't match, and if too many genotypes in a row.

o scanone() with model="2part" gives NAs as LOD scores if there
  is complete penetrance (one of the p's goes to 1).  This doesn't
  happen with model="binary".

  The problem is that if everyone with a certain genotype survives,
  then you have great segregation distortion if you look at only
  the dead individuals, and so you can't estimate both means.

o Incorporate the DIRECT algorithm stuff from Hao

o scanone with additive alleles at QTL

o Pull out results for an interval from scanone.

o Add additional HMM functions for the X chr in RIL, as the marginal
  genotype distribution is 2:1 rather than 1:1 and the transition
  matrix is not symmetric Pr(BB|AA) = 2r/(1+4r) and Pr(AA|BB) =
  4r/(1+4r)

o Ability to get at the individual contributions to the LOD score? 

o Incorporate code from Brian Yandell, Fei Zou and Amy Jin on
  semi-parametric QTL mapping methods.

o Add appropriate functions to analyze advanced intercrosses (AILs)
  and advanced backcross (BCn). 

o Analysis of binary traits by imputation

o Allow phenotypes on multiple individuals (esp for recombinant inbred
  lines). 

o 2 traits vs genotype at one QTL (with regression lines)

o eQTL-related stuff:
  
  - Compressing calc.genoprob results (simpler version of locations,
    or just the grid)

  - Mb positions within cross object; multiple genetic maps
  
  - Positions in phenotype object + other annotations

----------------------------------------------------------------------

LONG TERM:

o Imprinting/parent-of-origin effects.

o Treating a covariate as a random effect.

o Multiple phenotypes (esp. regarding pleiotropy).

o Model search for MIM etc...forward and stepwise selection.

o Function to plot, for a specified q1, LOD{q2|q1} vs q2 (using the
  output from scantwo).

o Take the fit of the null model outside of the C code for
  the imputation method in scanone and scantwo, so that it
  only has to be done once (rather than for each chr or chr pair).

o Starting values for EM for the two-part model (and more generally).
  Allow the option of an automatic selection of multiple starting
  points. 

o Generalized linear models in scanone and scantwo.

o Analysis functions such as scanone and scantwo might assign an
  attribute to their output which identifies the input data and/or
  function call.

o Re-write the C code for EM underneath scanone and scantwo so that it
  is not so tedious.
